# Python ~~  Task Scheduler
     Problem

    We are given a list of tasks (like ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']) and a cooling period n.
    After running a task, we must wait n time units before running the same task again.
    If no task is ready, the CPU must stay idle.
    We need to find the minimum total time (including idle time) to finish all tasks.

## Approach 
    ~ Count how many of each task we need to run.
    ~ Keep track of when each task can run again using a dictionary.
    ~ Loop through each time unit:
    ~ Pick any task that is ready and still has work left.
    ~ If no task is ready, the CPU goes idle.
    ~ Stop when all tasks are done and return the total time.
    ~ This approach is simple and simulates the ~ ~ ~ process step by step â€” great for understanding before optimizing.
